# Mercari-Price-Suggestion-Challenge
For a given item, we need to suggest the price of that item given its different features like category, name, brand name, item description etc.

Error metric: RMSLE (Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error)


Objectives:
Predict the price of an item given its condition, description and other related features.
Minimize the difference between predicted and actual price (RMSLE)
Try to provide some interpretability
